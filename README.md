# Visual-Basic-Fast-Food-Program

The purpose of this app is to program a fast food program for making sure that the customer can make an order easier, by just using the app. 

After the customer selects their order it prompts them to check the order again and correct anything that looks off.

In the end, the program calculates the cost of the food orders and also calulates the tax based on 8.25%, displays the subtotal (without tax) and the 
total with tax.
